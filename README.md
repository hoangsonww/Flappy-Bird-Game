# Flappy Bird Game in Swift

Created by [Son Nguyen](https://github.com/hoangsonww) in 2024, this project is a whole new version of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, developed using Swift and SpriteKit for iOS. The game aims to replicate the original's gameplay, featuring a bird that the player navigates between a series of obstacles by tapping the screen to make the bird fly. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score by avoiding the pipes.
